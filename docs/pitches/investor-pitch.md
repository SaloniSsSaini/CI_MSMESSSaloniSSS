## Carbon Intelligence — Investor Pitch (Detailed)

![Look & feel tokens](./assets/style-tokens.svg)

### 1) One-liner
**Carbon Intelligence helps MSMEs measure emissions, reduce costs, and prove progress—then uses that verified data to unlock better-priced green finance for banks.**

---

### 2) The problem (why now)
- **Supply-chain and finance pressure is rising**: MSMEs are increasingly asked for sustainability evidence by large customers and lenders.
- **Most MSMEs run on fragmented data**: invoices/bills sit in emails and folders; reporting becomes manual, late, and unauditable.
- **Banks face an “ESG data gap”**: lenders want better risk signals and portfolio reporting, but SME ESG data is inconsistent and expensive to obtain.

**Result:** compliance is painful, decarbonization is slow, and finance is mispriced.

---

### 3) The product (what we built)
Carbon Intelligence is a workflow platform with three core pillars:
- **Measure**: guided carbon footprint assessment (energy, water/waste, transport, materials, process, controls) with outputs for **total CO₂**, **category breakdown**, and **ESG Scopes 1/2/3**.
- **Improve**: **recommendations** prioritized by impact, cost, timeline, savings, and payback.
- **Prove**: **reporting + export** plus a **document evidence layer** (upload, extraction, duplicate detection, carbon signals).

These flows exist today in the product experience (web + mobile).

### 4) Why we win: the data → action → finance loop
The platform compounds because every step strengthens the next.

**Investable insight:** we’re not only “carbon accounting.” We’re building a **decision + evidence system** that enables **financing** (origination + risk insights).

### 5) Product proof-points (from the current UI flows)
#### 5.1 Carbon footprint assessment (guided stepper)
Captures operational inputs and outputs a score + scope breakdown + recommended actions.

#### 5.2 Document intelligence (evidence + cleanliness)
Uploads bills/invoices, extracts structured fields, computes CO₂ signals, and flags duplicates—making reporting and underwriting more reliable.

![Document management](./assets/product-document-management.svg)

#### 5.3 Reporting (shareable outcomes)
Charts, trends, recommendation status, and export/email/print flows that stakeholders actually consume.

#### 5.4 Green loans (conversion into finance)
Pre-check eligibility and show transparent terms based on carbon score and reduction plan, then submit applications.

### 6) Market and wedge
**Wedge:** MSME carbon assessment + reporting + recommendations (fast time-to-value).

**Expansion:**
- evidence/document workflows (audit packs, supplier requests)
- industry benchmarking and continuous monitoring
- incentives discovery and application support
- bank/fintech integrations for green products (eligibility, pricing, monitoring)

---

### 7) Business model (how it makes money)
Multiple paths (can be phased):
- **SaaS (MSME)**: subscription per company/site, tiered by features (reporting, documents, forecasting).
- **Usage**: per report export, per processed document, per audit pack.
- **Bank revenue**: origination/referral or platform fee for green-loan enablement + monitoring.
- **Marketplace** (future): verified service providers (audits/consulting) + carbon credit rails.

---

### 8) Defensibility
- **Workflow lock-in**: once reporting + documents + recommendations are embedded, switching cost rises.
- **Data moat**: labeled activity + document data enables better benchmarks and underwriting signals over time.
- **Distribution advantage**: banks and anchor enterprises can onboard MSMEs via supply chain / portfolio programs.

---

### 9) What we need to prove next (fundraising-ready milestones)
Investors will typically look for:
- **Repeatable acquisition**: bank channel or supply-chain channel that reliably onboards MSMEs.
- **Retention/expansion**: documents processed, reports exported, recommendations implemented.
- **Outcome metrics**: ₹ cost savings and kg CO₂ reduction per MSME cohort.
- **Bank proof**: underwriting or monitoring improvements (time saved, default risk signal lift, portfolio coverage).

### 10) Suggested “talk track” (2 minutes)
1. MSMEs and banks both have a data gap: sustainability is required, but evidence is messy and expensive.  
2. Carbon Intelligence turns everyday operational data into carbon outputs, then gives prioritized actions with ROI.  
3. The system produces audit-ready reports and evidence trails via document intelligence.  
4. That verified dataset becomes a financial primitive: better eligibility, better pricing, better monitoring for green loans.  
5. We monetize SaaS + usage on MSMEs and platform/origination economics with banks, with compounding defensibility from workflow + data.
