![Dashboard experience](./assets/product-dashboard-web.svg)

### The promise
**Measure your carbon footprint, cut operating costs, and generate shareable sustainability reports—without spreadsheets or consultants.**

---

### What MSMEs get (clear benefits)
- **Win more customers**: share reports and evidence when buyers ask for sustainability compliance.
- **Reduce electricity/fuel/material waste**: recommendations are prioritized by impact, savings, and payback.
- **Get audit-ready faster**: centralize bills/invoices and maintain a clean evidence trail.
- **Access green finance**: convert carbon performance into loan eligibility and better pricing.

---

### How it works (simple flow)
#### 1) Start with a guided carbon assessment
Answer a short, step-by-step questionnaire across energy, water/waste, transport, materials, and processes.

**You receive:**
- total CO₂
- category breakdown
- ESG scopes (1/2/3)
- carbon score
- a recommended action list

#### 2) Turn insights into action (with ROI)
Recommendations are not generic tips—each action includes:
- **priority** (high/medium/low)
- **estimated savings (₹)** and **payback (months)**
- **estimated CO₂ reduction**

This makes it easy to pick “quick wins” first and plan larger upgrades next.

#### 3) Keep documents organized and “report-ready”
Upload bills/invoices and let the platform extract key fields, detect duplicates, and compute carbon signals from spend.

**Why MSMEs care:** fewer manual errors, less time spent chasing files, and easier responses to audits or customer requests.

#### 4) Generate reports you can share
Build and export reports for customers, internal reviews, and compliance.

### Green finance: convert sustainability into capital
When MSMEs plan a reduction project (e.g., solar, efficient machinery, waste systems), Carbon Intelligence helps:
- check **eligibility** up front
- show **transparent terms**
- submit a **clean application** based on verified activity + reduction plan

### “What’s in it for me?” (MSME ROI framing)
- **Time saved**: less manual reporting and document hunting.
- **Cost savings**: energy/fuel/process improvements with clear payback.
- **Revenue enablement**: meet buyer requirements and improve trust.
- **Better financing access**: use data to qualify for green loans and incentives.

### Suggested 30-second sales script (MSME)
Carbon Intelligence helps you measure your carbon footprint, reduce costs, and prove it with exportable reports. You upload bills and documents once, get a clean audit trail, and receive prioritized actions with savings and payback. As your carbon score improves, you can also unlock green finance with better terms.
