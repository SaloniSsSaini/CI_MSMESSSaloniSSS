![Data → Action → Finance loop](./assets/platform-loop.svg)

### The promise
**Convert SME sustainability data from a compliance burden into a scalable underwriting + portfolio reporting advantage—while growing green loan originations.**

---

### Why banks use this (bank value drivers)
- **Grow green lending efficiently**: onboard MSMEs with a guided assessment + evidence pack that reduces loan processing friction.
- **Better risk signals**: carbon score, emissions trajectory, recommendation adoption, and document-backed activity data improve monitoring and underwriting.
- **Portfolio visibility**: standardized outputs across MSMEs for internal dashboards and external disclosures.
- **Lower cost-to-serve**: fewer back-and-forth document requests; fewer data quality issues; faster credit files.

### What the platform produces (standardized “bank-ready” outputs)
#### 1) Verified evidence layer (documents)
MSMEs upload bills/invoices; the system structures fields, flags duplicates, and keeps an audit trail.

**Why it matters to a bank:** improved data cleanliness reduces fraud/duplicates and makes sustainability claims defensible.

#### 2) Carbon + ESG outputs (comparable across customers)
Standardized carbon outputs for each MSME:
- total CO₂ + category split
- ESG scope split (1/2/3)
- carbon score + trend
- recommended actions + payback

#### 3) Green loan enablement (origination workflow)
Eligibility checks + transparent term preview based on policy rules and carbon score.

### How a bank can deploy it (3 common models)
- **Model A — Bank-led onboarding**: bank offers the tool to MSME customers to prepare “green loan ready” profiles.
- **Model B — Co-lending / partner channel**: embed Carbon Intelligence into a partner program and share standardized outputs.
- **Model C — Portfolio monitoring**: existing borrowers are enrolled for ongoing data capture, reporting, and early-warning signals.

---

### Bank KPIs this product can improve
- **Acquisition**: more qualified green loan leads per RM/branch.
- **Approval speed**: fewer document gaps; cleaner eligibility checks.
- **Portfolio reporting coverage**: % of MSME book with standardized sustainability data.
- **Monitoring**: emissions trend and action adoption as risk/engagement signals.

### Suggested 30-second sales script (Bank)
Carbon Intelligence standardizes how MSMEs capture sustainability data and evidence, turning bills and activity inputs into carbon scores, ESG scope outputs, and audit-ready reports. That verified dataset can be plugged into green lending: faster eligibility, cleaner loan files, better monitoring, and scalable portfolio visibility—while improving MSME engagement and retention.
